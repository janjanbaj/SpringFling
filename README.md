# SpringFling
WLU Spring Fling.  A match making algorithm and platform. Once a year during Spring Term @WLU


Never merge to main directly. I am thinking we do something like this
[!https://www.pablogonzalez.io/content/images/2023/05/CI_CD-inner-images_Gitflow-workflow.png]
- Feature Branch -> Develop -> Main . Unless tested hotfix.



# Frontend:
We can use either Solid.js or Svelte.js (SvelteKit).

## Data Science:
Load SQLite on the browser and then use D3.js to load into the browser. WASM accelerated code maybe? 

# Algorithm:
We will just use Python because it is much easier. We need a pipeline that goes from Pocketbase to Python (probably just the api) back to the database.



# LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING THINGS IF YOU WANT TO COMMIT:
- Pocketbase : Backend Server that is hosted in one file. Learn how it works.
- Sveltekit: Similar to React in the sense it is a JS Framework but in my opinion much easier.
