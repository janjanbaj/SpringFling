# Stable Matching Literature:

- McVite and Wilson made a version of Gale-Shapley that basically finds all possible Stable Marriages.
- Algorithm 411 is the document that consists of the Algol code for it. reads as pseudocode.
- Irving, Leather, and Gusfeild present an algorithm for the optimal stable matching. I found the former two papers refrenced in this paper.
